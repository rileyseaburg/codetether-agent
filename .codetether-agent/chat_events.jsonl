The test is checking `CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT` but the test runs after other tests that may have set different environment variables.\n\nLooking at line 468 - it expects `cfg.endpoint` to be `Some(\"https://test.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\".to_string())` but it's None. This means the endpoint isn't being picked up.\n\nThe issue is test isolation. The `from_env` function looks for both `S3_ENDPOINT` and `CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT`. The test sets `CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT`, but if `S3_ENDPOINT` is also set to something, it might be getting priority or something else is wrong.\n\nWait, I see - the test runs `clean_env()` at the end of previous tests, so the environment should be clean. Let me look more closely - the problem might be that earlier tests set these environment variables, then call `clean_env()`, but the clean happens in a different module's test, which may not clear the S3 variables properly, or the order of test execution could cause race conditions.\n\nActually wait - looking at the test, it does `clean_env()` at the START (line 451), sets the variables, then asserts. But the assertion fails at line 468, which checks the endpoint. Let me look at what line 468 is:\n\n```rust\nassert_eq!(\n    cfg.endpoint,\n    Some(\"https://test.r2.cloudflarestorage.com\".to_string())\n);\n```\n\nSo `cfg.endpoint` is `None` but it should be `Some(...)`.\n\nLooking at the `from_env` function at lines 103-105:\n```rust\nlet endpoint = std::env::var(\"S3_ENDPOINT\")\n    .or_else(|_| std::env::var(\"CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT\"))\n    .ok();\n```\n\nThis should work - it first tries `S3_ENDPOINT`, then falls back to `CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT`. If neither is set, it returns `None`. But the test sets `CODETETHER_S3_ENDPOINT` so it should work.\n\nOH! I see the issue now. Let me look at the order of setting variables in the test:\n\n```rust\nunsafe {\n    std::env::set_var(\"CODETETHER_S3_BUCKET\", \"test-bucket\");\n    std::env::set_var(\"CODETETHER_S3_PREFIX\", \"audit/\");\n    std::env::set_var(\n```\n\nThe test is setting environment variables in an unsafe block, but there's a race condition or the variables aren't being set before `from_env()` reads them. The test cleans the environment first, then sets the variables, but something's preventing the fallback from working correctly. The test clears both the legacy and new S3 environment variables, then sets only the legacy CODETETHER_S3_BUCKET. Since from_env prioritizes S3_BUCKET first and returns None if it's missing, the function should fall back to CODETETHER_S3_BUCKET. But I need to verify whether other tests are leaving S3_ENDPOINT set, which could affect this test's behavior.","tool_name":null,"tool_success":null,"tool_duration_ms":null}

Looking at the original code more carefully, I need to take the session out of the store, use it, and then put it back.\n\nThe problem is that we're moving `session` into the async block but then we also need to use it after to store the updated session.\n\nLet me check what the original code was doing - I see it was doing a clone: `entry.session.clone()` - but actually wait, looking at line 213 it was doing that. The issue is we need the session in the async block and we also need it after.\n\nActually, looking at the code:\n1. We get `entry` from store_get (cloned)\n2. We extract `session` from entry \n3. We spawn the session into a task\n4. After the task, we use session again\n\nSo we DO need to keep session alive after the spawn. The solution is to clone session for the spawn and keep the original.\n\nWait, let me re-read the original code:\n```rust\nlet mut session = {\n    let mut store = AGENT_STORE.write();\n    let entry = store.get_mut(&name)?;\n    entry.session.clone()\n};\n```\n\nThe original clones the session, so the original session stays in the store.
