- 3² + 4² = 5² (9 + 16 = 25)

### Algebraic Properties

**Modular Arithmetic:**
- Base-5 (quinary) number system
- The multiplicative order of 10 modulo 5 is 1
- Cyclic group properties in Z/5Z

**Polynomial Roots:**
- The fifth roots of unity form a regular pentagon on the complex plane

## Conclusion

The number 5 demonstrates remarkable consistency in its significance across human experience. From its mathematical properties as a prime number and its geometric manifestation in pentagons, to its cultural symbolism in religion and daily life, and its linguistic presence in Indo-European languages, the number 5 serves as a bridge between abstract mathematical concepts and tangible human experience.

The ubiquity of 5 in human counting systems (based on five fingers), its appearance in fundamental mathematical structures, and its role in cultural and religious frameworks suggests a deep connection between human cognition and this number. Whether through the pentatonic scales in music, the five senses of perception, or the five pillars of major religions, the number 5 continues to organise and structure human understanding of the world.
