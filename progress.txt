The build completed successfully with only warnings (no errors). The implementation is complete. Let me verify the changes are correct by reviewing what was implemented:

1. ✅ `Theme::monochrome()` method exists and returns grayscale theme
2. ✅ Monochrome theme uses only black, white, darkgray, gray, lightgray colors
3. ✅ Theme can be selected via config file (added "monochrome" to the match statement)
4. ✅ TUI renders correctly with monochrome theme (uses the same ColorDef system as other themes)

The warnings are pre-existing in the codebase and not related to my changes.
