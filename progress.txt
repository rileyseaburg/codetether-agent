The build passes with only warnings (no errors). The warnings are pre-existing and not related to my changes.

Let me verify the implementation meets all the acceptance criteria:

1. ✅ A tokio::spawn task sends POST /v1/opencode/workers/{worker_id}/heartbeat every 30 seconds - Implemented in `start_heartbeat` function
2. ✅ Heartbeat payload includes worker_id, agent_name, status (idle/processing), and active_task_count - Included in the JSON payload
3. ✅ Heartbeat starts when the worker connects and stops when the worker shuts down - Started before `connect_stream`, cancelled on disconnect with `heartbeat_handle.abort()`
4. ✅ 3 consecutive heartbeat failures log an error but do not terminate the worker - Implemented with `consecutive_failures` counter and `MAX_FAILURES = 3`
5. ✅ Heartbeat uses the same auth token as the SSE connection - Passed `args.token.clone()` to heartbeat task
6. ✅ Heartbeat loop is cancelled and restarted on SSE reconnection - `heartbeat_handle.abort()` called before reconnect sleep
